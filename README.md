# python-wrapper-for-zfs

This is a light python wrapper for zfs. It allows you to mount and unmount datasets, create new datasets, list all existing datasets, destroy a dataset, and create and send a snapshot of a dataset. The encryption key can also be loaded, which has to happen before mounting can occur.
